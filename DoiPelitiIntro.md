## Brief introduction to Doi-Peliti Field Theory

Doi-Peliti Field Theory is a method to describe stochastic processes which can be cast in a Master Equation. It is an equivalent representation to the Master Equation and does inprinciple not involve simplifications or approximations which can occur when deriving Fokker-Planck Equations or Langevin Equations.
The reason why I present some introductory information about Doi-Peliti Field Theory here is that there are not many textbook-level notes avilable and easily accessible. The derivation of Doi-Peliti Field theory follows three steps:
 <ol>
  <li>Set-up of Master Equation</li>
  <li>Using Second Quantization to derive an equivalent Equation of the Probability Generating Function</li>
  <li>Deriving the Action of the Field Theory</li>
</ol>
