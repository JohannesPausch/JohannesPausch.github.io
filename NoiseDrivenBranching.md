**Motivation**: It is crucial to understand when epidemic spreading will eventually come to a halt or when there is a chance it might continue indefinitely. This is often described using the R_0 factor/number. Additional noise can make the calculation of R_0 and the boundary/critical point where R_0=1 very difficult. In this paper, we examine three types of noise: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, telegraphic noise and noise due to a mix of populations and calculate the corresponding R_0=1 boundary.
