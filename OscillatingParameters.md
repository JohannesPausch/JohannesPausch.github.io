## Branching and Oscillations in Neuronal Avalanches

This was a project in collaboration with Rosalba Garcia-Millan and Gunnar Pruessner. Most of the results were published _Sci. Rep._ **10**:13678 (2020) under the title: time‚Äêdependent branching processes: a model of oscillating neuronal avalanches.

# Motivation
Avalanches in the brain exhibit two seemingly contradicting characteristics: they show time-scale invariance when the statistics of avalanche lengths or sizes are considered, hinting at critical behaviour, **but** they also show time-scale dependent oscillations as modulations of avalanches.
The article explores how both properties can coexist by considering branching processes close to criticality for which the extinction rate oscillates.

# Methods and Results
The article is based on the project on the field theory of [branching processes](Branching.md) and adjusts the used action to include oscillating parameters.
